## Introduction

 Recent state-of-the-art super-resolution methods provide some solutions, but these methods make their model convergent to a specific maps under the constraint of prior knowledge, resulting in severe loss of details when these methods are dealing with low-resolution images in the real world. To solve these problems, we propose OTSR: an image super-resolution method based on the optimal transmission theory.
